  <h2 class="text-2xl uppercase bold center mb-8">Hello, I'm Kernen Yabut.</h2>
  <div>
    <p>Welcome to my little site! I'm an introverted technological tinkerer who enjoys building internet stuff with code. Hailing from the growing Region of Waterloo in Ontario, Canada, I'm an aspiring software developer and a graduate of Conestoga College's Computer Programmer/Analyst program.</p>
    <br/>
    <p>Ever since I first used my uncle's computer at the age of 3, my interest in computers and technology in general sparked when I played with a game. As I grew, I engaged in the early 2000's internet scene with Newgrounds, YouTube, and Adobe Flash games and animations. It's when the more I indulged, the more I see the logic and design for some of these games/apps; from ammo counters reaching 0 means a flag is triggered to play a reload animation, to inventory systems being a glorified array of objects. This logic handling lead to my first experience in the field when I was 12. I was invited to a web developer workshop hosted by Conestoga for elementary schools, where I was taught the very basics of what makes a website (mainly filling in the blanks and exploring the limited directory), regardless it was a telltale sign of how I can enjoy solving problems with the power of code. 3 years later in high school, I was invited by my friend to my school's programming club, where I took said interest in problem solving to make Snake written in Turing, followed by assisting (in reality, just commenting/debugging on a GitHub repo) with my friend's casino game.</p>
    <br/>
    <p>That random day of being dragged into the club room inspired me to go further and embark on my current career path! At that time, I didn't even consider what I will be when I finally grow up. Taking computer science classes through my final years, I honed my skills in learning Java and developed applications such as a Craps game to a phone directory. After graduating high school, I studied at Conestoga College as part of the Computer Programmer/Analyst program, where I further refined my skills in various languages such as Java, C#, HTML/CSS, C++, and PHP, while also meeting and colaborating a multitude of different people with projects and assignments. Afterwards, during my gap years, I picked up Python and dabbled in the emerging field of artificial intellgence and machine learning while working as a link ambassador for a seniors' center on my free time. Currently, I’m seeking a full-time role where I can embark on my journey to meaningfully contribute to a company and achieve their goals.
